            If your 2 year old has turned bedtime into an elaborate negotiation that stretches an hour or more past lights-out, you're not alone. This is one of the most universal experiences of parenting a 2 year old — and one of the most exhausting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news: it's completely fixable. And no, you don't need to be harsh or ignore your child's needs. You just need to understand <em>why</em> they're doing it and respond with the right combination of empathy and firmness.

            Why Your 2 Year Old Fights Bedtime
          </h2>
          <p>
            Understanding the "why" changes everything. Your 2 year old isn't fighting bedtime to be difficult. They're fighting it because of three powerful developmental forces:
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)</h3>
          <p>
            Your toddler knows that you stay up after they go to bed. They don't know what you're doing — but they're certain it must be amazing. Every request to get out of bed is an attempt to be part of whatever is happening without them. This is why the stalling gets worse when they can hear you talking, watching TV, or doing dishes.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">The Need for Control</h3>
          <p>
            At age 2, your child has discovered they have a will — and they want to use it. Bedtime is one of the few moments in the day where they have almost no control. They can't choose when it happens, and they can't choose to opt out. Every stall tactic is an attempt to exert control over the one thing they can influence: how long they stay awake.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-charcoal mt-8 mb-3">Genuine Connection Needs</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes the stalling isn't strategic — it's emotional. If your 2 year old hasn't had enough quality connection with you during the day (especially common for children in childcare or with working parents), bedtime becomes their last chance to be close to you. They're not manipulating; they're reaching for you.
          </p>

            This is often linked to the broader <Link href="/blog/2-year-sleep-regression" className="text-brand-teal hover:underline">2 year sleep regression</Link>, which amplifies all of these behaviours.

            The Scripts: What to Say (and What Not to Say)
          </h2>
          <p>
            The words you use matter more than you might think. Here are proven scripts for the most common stalling tactics:
          </p>

          <div className="bg-brand-cream rounded-xl p-6 my-8 space-y-6">
            <div>
              <p className="font-bold text-brand-charcoal">"One more story!"</p>
              <p className="text-brand-charcoal/70 mt-1"><strong>Say:</strong> "We read our two stories. I loved reading with you tonight. Tomorrow you get to pick two more. Now it's time for sleep."</p>
              <p className="text-brand-charcoal/50 mt-1 text-sm"><strong>Don't say:</strong> "Fine, just one more" — this teaches them that negotiation works.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p className="font-bold text-brand-charcoal">"I need water!"</p>
              <p className="text-brand-charcoal/70 mt-1"><strong>Say:</strong> "Your water is right there on the nightstand." (Pre-empt this by making water part of the routine.)</p>
              <p className="text-brand-charcoal/50 mt-1 text-sm"><strong>Don't say:</strong> "Okay, I'll go get you some" — getting up and leaving creates a new cycle.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p className="font-bold text-brand-charcoal">"I need to tell you something important!"</p>
              <p className="text-brand-charcoal/70 mt-1"><strong>Say:</strong> "Tell me in the morning. I'll be here and I want to hear it. Right now it's sleep time."</p>
              <p className="text-brand-charcoal/50 mt-1 text-sm"><strong>Don't say:</strong> "What is it?" — this opens a conversation that won't end.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p className="font-bold text-brand-charcoal">"I'm scared!"</p>
              <p className="text-brand-charcoal/70 mt-1"><strong>Say:</strong> "I understand. You're safe. Your nightlight is on and I'm right next door. Let's think about something fun — what do you want to dream about?"</p>
              <p className="text-brand-charcoal/50 mt-1 text-sm"><strong>Don't say:</strong> "There's nothing to be scared of" — this dismisses their feelings and doesn't help.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p className="font-bold text-brand-charcoal">"I'm not tired!"</p>
              <p className="text-brand-charcoal/70 mt-1"><strong>Say:</strong> "You don't have to be tired. You just need to stay in bed. Your body will fall asleep when it's ready."</p>
              <p className="text-brand-charcoal/50 mt-1 text-sm"><strong>Don't say:</strong> "Yes you are!" — you can't win a debate about how someone else feels.</p>
            </div>

            The Bedtime Pass: A Game-Changer for Stallers
          </h2>
          <p>
            The bedtime pass is one of the most effective tools for 2 year olds who stall. Here's how it works:
          </p>
          <p>
            Give your child one physical "pass" at bedtime — a card, a token, or even a sticker on their hand. They can use this pass for <strong>one</strong> approved request: one hug, one trip to the toilet, one drink of water. Once they've used it, it's gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the pass is still unused in the morning, they get bonus praise or a small reward (a sticker on a chart, choosing breakfast, picking the first book tomorrow night).
          </p>
          <p>
            Why it works: it gives your child control (they get to decide <em>when</em> to use their pass) while setting a clear, concrete boundary (only one). Most children save their pass "just in case," and end up not using it at all.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-brand-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">
            The Controlled Choices Strategy
          </h2>
          <p>
            Since control is a primary driver of bedtime battles at age 2, the solution is to give your child <em>more</em> control — but only where you choose. Offer two acceptable options at every step of the <Link href="/blog/toddler-bedtime-routine" className="text-brand-teal hover:underline">bedtime routine</Link>:
          </p>
          <p>
            "Do you want the blue pyjamas or the green ones?" "Do you want to brush teeth first or put on pyjamas first?" "Do you want to read the bear book or the train book?" "Do you want a hug or a high-five goodnight?"
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time they reach lights-out, they've made 4 to 5 choices. Their need for control has been satisfied — through the routine, not through stalling.
          </p>

            5 Things That Make Bedtime Battles Worse
          </h2>
          <ol className="space-y-4 my-6">
            <li><strong className="text-brand-charcoal">Giving in "just this once."</strong> Every time you give one more story, one more hug, or five more minutes, you're teaching your child that persistence works. They'll push harder tomorrow.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-brand-charcoal">Long, drawn-out goodbyes.</strong> Keep the farewell brief and confident. Lingering at the door signals that you're uncertain about leaving, which makes your child uncertain about being left.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-brand-charcoal">Bedtime too late.</strong> An overtired 2 year old is a wired 2 year old. They <em>look</em> energetic, but they're running on cortisol. Move bedtime earlier, not later.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-brand-charcoal">Screens within an hour of bed.</strong> The stimulation and blue light make it physiologically harder for your child to wind down.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-brand-charcoal">Inconsistency between parents.</strong> If one parent enforces the rules and the other gives in, your child quickly learns who to target. Get on the same page — ideally before bedtime, not during it.</li>
          </ol>
