            Just when you think you've got sleep figured out, it falls apart again. That's the nature of sleep regressions — predictable disruptions in your child's sleep tied to specific developmental milestones. The good news: they're temporary. The better news: once you know when they're coming and why, you can handle them with far less panic and far more confidence.

          <p>
            Here's every major sleep regression from infancy through the preschool years — when to expect it, what causes it, how long it lasts, and what to do.

          {/* 4 Month */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-brand-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">
            The 4 Month Sleep Regression
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>When:</strong> 3.5 to 4.5 months &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 2-4 weeks
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the only regression that involves a permanent change in your baby's sleep architecture. Before 4 months, babies cycle between just two sleep stages. Around 4 months, their sleep matures to include the same four stages adults have — including lighter sleep phases where they're more easily woken.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why a baby who previously slept 6-hour stretches suddenly starts waking every 2 hours. It's not a setback — it's a biological upgrade. The adjustment period is what makes it feel like a regression.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What helps:</strong> Focus on helping your baby learn to fall asleep at the start of the night without being fully rocked or fed to sleep. This is the single most impactful change, because it allows them to resettle independently when they wake between the new sleep cycles.
          </p>

          {/* 6 Month */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-brand-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">
            The 6 Month Sleep Regression
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>When:</strong> 5.5 to 6.5 months &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 1-2 weeks
          </p>
          <p>
            Not every baby experiences this one. It's driven by physical milestones — learning to sit, roll, and potentially starting solids. Some babies are so excited by their new physical abilities that they practise them at 3 AM. Others are disrupted by digestive changes as solids are introduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What helps:</strong> Give plenty of time to practise new physical skills during the day. If they're getting stuck rolling in the cot, help them briefly but avoid picking them up. This regression tends to resolve quickly on its own.
          </p>

          {/* 8-10 Month */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-brand-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">
            The 8-10 Month Sleep Regression
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>When:</strong> 8 to 10 months &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 2-3 weeks
          </p>
          <p>
            Separation anxiety peaks for the first time around 8-9 months. Your baby now understands "object permanence" — they know you exist even when you leave the room, and they don't want you to go. Crawling, pulling up, and teething often coincide, creating a triple disruption.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What helps:</strong> Practise brief separations during the day (peekaboo is perfect for this). Maintain a consistent <Link href="/blog/toddler-bedtime-routine" className="text-brand-teal hover:underline">bedtime routine</Link>. Offer comfort without creating new sleep associations.
          </p>

          {/* 12 Month */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-brand-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">
            The 12 Month Sleep Regression
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>When:</strong> 11 to 13 months &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 1-2 weeks
          </p>
          <p>
            Walking (or the build-up to walking) is usually the culprit. Your baby is also becoming aware that they can refuse things — including sleep. Some babies attempt to drop to one nap around this age, but most aren't actually ready until 14-18 months.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What helps:</strong> Don't drop to one nap yet — it's almost certainly too early. Keep offering two naps. This regression is typically short-lived if you maintain consistency.
          </p>

          {/* 18 Month */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-brand-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">
            The 18 Month Sleep Regression
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>When:</strong> 15 to 20 months &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 2-6 weeks
          </p>
          <p>
            This is widely considered the hardest regression. It combines intense separation anxiety, the 2-to-1 nap transition, teething (18-month molars), and a surge in independence and willfulness. Bedtime resistance, <Link href="/blog/18-month-nap-strike" className="text-brand-teal hover:underline">nap strikes</Link>, and night wakings all intensify simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What helps:</strong> Consolidate to one midday nap if you haven't already. Move bedtime earlier. Increase connection during the day to reduce separation anxiety at night. Stay consistent even when it feels like nothing is working — this regression tests your resolve more than any other.

            The 2 Year Sleep Regression
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>When:</strong> 22 to 26 months &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 2-6 weeks
          </p>
          <p>
            The 2 year regression is driven by a new combination: FOMO, a developing imagination that creates <Link href="/blog/toddler-afraid-of-dark" className="text-brand-teal hover:underline">fear of the dark</Link>, and verbal ability that turns bedtime into an elaborate negotiation. <Link href="/blog/2-year-old-fighting-bedtime" className="text-brand-teal hover:underline">Bedtime battles and stalling</Link> are the hallmark of this regression — your toddler will ask for one more story, one more hug, one more glass of water in an endless loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What helps:</strong> Offer controlled choices throughout the bedtime routine. Use the "bedtime pass" system. Pre-empt every request (water on nightstand, toilet trip in routine). Distinguish between genuine fears (validate) and stalling tactics (hold the boundary).
          </p>

            The 3 Year Sleep Regression
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>When:</strong> 2.5 to 3.5 years &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Duration:</strong> 2-4 weeks (longer if combined with <Link href="/blog/when-do-toddlers-stop-napping" className="text-brand-teal hover:underline">nap dropping</Link>)
          </p>
          <p>
            The final major regression. It's characterised by three converging factors: the transition away from daytime naps, sophisticated nighttime fears and nightmares, and major life transitions (preschool, potty training, new siblings, big bed). Night terrors may also appear for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What helps:</strong> Manage the nap-to-quiet-time transition gradually. Move bedtime earlier to compensate for lost daytime sleep. Use the "Worry Eater" technique for fears. Limit screen time, especially content that could fuel nighttime imagination.

          {/* The Pattern */}
          <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-brand-charcoal mt-12 mb-4">
            The Pattern Across All Regressions
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you look across every regression age, a clear pattern emerges. Each one is triggered by a developmental leap — your child is growing, learning, and changing, and their sleep temporarily suffers as their brain and body adapt. And while the specific strategies differ by age, the foundational principles remain the same:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Maintain your routine.</strong> The <Link href="/blog/toddler-bedtime-routine" className="text-brand-teal hover:underline">bedtime routine</Link> is your anchor. Don't abandon it when things get hard — lean into it harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avoid creating new sleep dependencies.</strong> Extra comfort during a regression is fine. But if you start rocking, feeding, or lying with your child to sleep during a regression, those habits will persist long after the regression ends.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Adjust the schedule, not the method.</strong> If sleep is disrupted, look at the schedule first — are they getting too much daytime sleep? Not enough? Is bedtime too late? Schedule adjustments resolve most regression symptoms faster than anything else.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Be patient and consistent.</strong> Every regression ends. The question is whether you come out the other side with the same healthy sleep habits you went in with, or whether new habits have formed that need to be undone.
          </p>
